This project uses the following data source: 
[countries@current](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/countries/home)

To get started, clone the repo and then:

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.
